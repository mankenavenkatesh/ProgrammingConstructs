# What is Data Buffer

Buffer is temporary placeholder in memory (ram/disk) on which data can be dumped and then processing can be done.

# When to use Data Buffers
- Buffers are typically used when there is a difference between the rate at which data is received and the rate at which it can be processed, or in the case that these rates are variable, for example in a printer spooler or in online video streaming.
