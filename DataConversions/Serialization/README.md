# What is Serialization?

Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes to store the object or transmit it to memory, a database, or a file. Its main purpose is to save the state of an object in order to be able to recreate it when needed. The reverse process is called deserialization.


## What is difference between Serialization and Encoding?
```
Serialization - convert object to standard message (JSON, XML, Protobuf)
Encoding - convert standard message to byte stream using encoding scheme
```
